# Privacy Policy for Post & Prune

Effective Date: December 26, 2025

## Introduction

Post & Prune is an open-source application designed to give users full control over their data. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data in relation to the application.

## Data Collection

- **No Data Collection**: Post & Prune does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users. All application data resides solely on the user's device.
- **User-Controlled Data**: Users are responsible for managing their own data, which includes creating, storing, and deleting it as needed.

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: All data generated by Post & Prune is stored locally on the user's system. This ensures that users retain complete ownership and control over their information.
- **Data Backup**: Users are encouraged to implement their own data backup procedures, as the software does not provide automated backup features.

## Data Security

- **Local Security**: Users should take necessary precautions to secure their devices and data, including using firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption where appropriate.
- **No Server Interaction**: Since no data is transmitted over the Internet, the risk of interception during data transmission is eliminated.

## User Rights

- **Access to Data**: Users have the right to access and manage all data stored on their devices.
- **Data Deletion**: Users can delete any data created or managed through Post & Prune at their discretion.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any changes through the application's official communication channels.
